A new Flutter project.

## Starting point

Sorry for my bad English. This set up documentation is remind for me and I'm newbie in flutter.

### How to add localization in flutter?
First create new folder name is l10n under lib forder and then create new files.
first file name is app_en.arb for English and app_my.arb for burmese.
And then add l10n.yaml file under root folder.

If above all file(l10n folder, app_en.arb file, app_my.arb file and l10n.yaml) set up done, 
go to terminal and run command .\flutter pug get

If it is complete you can see generated file name is app_localizations.dart,
app_localizations_en.dart, app_localizations_my.dart under l10n folder.
